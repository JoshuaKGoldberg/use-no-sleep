**[NoSleep.js](https://github.com/ViRPo/NoSleep.js)**, in [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) form.
Use this hook to take your `enabled` state and translate it into NoSleep.js `enable`/`disable` calls.

## Usage

Import with either a named or default export:

```ts
import { useNoSleep } from "use-no-sleep";
import useNoSleep from "use-no-sleep";
```

`useNoSleep` takes in a single parameter, `enabled`, of type `boolean`.

```ts
useNoSleep(enabled);
```

### FAQs

#### Why NoSleep.js?

The [Wake Lock API](https://web.dev/wakelock) is not yet standardized or ready for browsers to implement.
Until then, NoSleep.js provides a workaround by playing a short silent video in the background.

#### Which NoSleep.js Version Does This Use?

This repository uses the [ViRPo fork](https://github.com/ViRPo/NoSleep.js) of the original [richtr/NoSleep.js](https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js) to help reduce CPU usage.
See https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js/issues/77.
